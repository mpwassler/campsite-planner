But while it wouldn’t be difficult to spend all your time exploring our country’s very first national park (and the second-largest in the lower 48 states), there is much to see and do in the opposite direction as well. Take a self-guided tour of Grand Teton National Park via the 43-mile Scenic Loop Drive, offering an opportunity to photograph the park’s famous landscape and local wildlife. Spend a few hours at Colter Bay Village, located about 30 minutes south of Headwaters Campground, where you can rent a kayak or canoe, take a guided boat ride to the majestic base of the Teton Range, or just enjoy lunch and the stunning lake view from the marina. Continue on and stop in at the historic Jackson Lake Lodge for its famous huckleberry milkshakes and spectacular Teton views through 60-foot tall wall-to-wall windows. While you’re there, book a scenic raft trip or park bus tour.

This 80-site campground is located adjacent to Signal Mountain Lodge which provides many amenities you might need for your National Park adventures.  The campground sits on the southeast shore of Jackson Lake and offers easy access to the lake waters and short walks to unparalleled views of the Teton Range.  The area is frequented by various park wildlife, large and small as well as a variety of bird species. The Signal Mountain Campground is normally one of the first campgrounds to open and last to close in the park and can often have lingering snowpack during the opening weeks after heavy winters and possible early wintery weather at the end of the season.  Due to the variability of weather in the Tetons, visitors should come prepared, especially during the months of May and October.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>There are many popular activities to be taken advantage of from the Signal Mountain Campground.  Hiking is a popular park activity and the campground provides direct access to two of the park’s shorter trails. The lakeshore trail is a 3 mile out-and-back trail following the lakeshore bluff to a popular backcountry campsite and the Signal Mountain Summit trail is a 6-mile loop trail.  Both trails provide breathtaking views and opportunities for wildlife viewing.  Being centrally located in GTNP, many of the park’s classic hikes are located within 15-20-minute drives including the Jenny Lake area, Lupine Meadows, Cascade Canyon, String Lake, Taggart Lake and Paintbrush Canyon trails to name a few. </p>\n<p>Another popular activity at the Signal Mountain Campground is playing on Jackson Lake.  This large alpine lake stretches nearly 7 miles wide and 15 miles long with a maximum depth over 400 feet. Water temperatures generally vary from 50-70 degrees during the campground’s season and is popular for trout fishing, power boats, kayaks and paddle boards. Signal Mountain Marina offers kayak, canoe and motor boat rentals which affords access to the lake for those traveling without their own gear. In addition, Signal Mountain Lodge offers guided fishing trips on Jackson Lake and scenic float trips on the Snake River, contact the Signal Mountain Lodge front desk for more information. Popular spots for swimming are at the boat ramp and picnic areas located at the north and south sides of the campground. </p>\n<p>Photography and sightseeing are other popular focuses for campers staying at the Signal Mountain Campground.  Want that iconic sunset or sunrise photo of the Tetons?  Look no further.  The area offers numerous great opportunities for landscape and nightscape photography often with the bonus for some wildlife shots. This is a great spot to spend your “rest” day during a busy vacation, but still feel like you can enjoy the park and not have to feel the need to get back in the car.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers tent camping and pull-in/back-in sites for RVs or trailers up to 30 feet. This campground offers 24 sites with 30 and 50-amp hookups which are popular during the early and late season. The campground is organized in three loops with the first loop mainly offering electrical hookup sites, and the last loop being “generator free”. Tent pads are available at select sites and all sites have picnic tables, fire rings and bear-proof food storage boxes. Parking pads and areas for tents can vary greatly in size and care should be given when selecting a site. The campground provides a dump station, trash collection and recycling receptacles. Four conveniently located comfort stations provide campers with potable water, flush toilets, camper sinks and hot water. The campground is part of the Signal Mountain Lodge facility which provides a number of additional amenities including token operated showers and laundromat, as well as internet access and on-site cell tower service. Other amenities include a general store (groceries, gas, camping supplies, coffee bar and grab and go food options), restaurants, bar, gift shops, guided float trips, guided fishing trips, boat rentals, cabin rentals and more. </p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n<p>The Signal Mountain Campground sits slightly elevated from Jackson Lake in a predominantly lodgepole pine forest which continues up Signal Mountain to the east.  Signal Mountain itself is an isolated glacial moraine which rises over 800ft and offers sweeping views of the Jackson Hole valley. The campground is located directly across the lake waters from Mt. Moran, the park’s second tallest peak. The dramatic Teton Range, from the Grand Teton to the south to the park’s northern peaks are visible from the lake shore and a few select sites.  The campground is frequented by various park wildlife including red fox, coyotes, bears, bats and mule deer to name a few.  Often bald eagles and osprey are found perched amongst the lake shore trees as they search the lake waters. To protect the park wildlife and fellow campers, proper food storage is enforced and regularly monitored</p>\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>Aside from centralized access to all Grand Teton National Park’s offerings including the Jenny Lake area, the Signal Mountain Campground offer’s convenient access to all of Jackson Hole and Yellowstone’s South Entrance in less than an hour’s drive.
